An R package of datasets and wrapper functions for [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)-friendly introductory linear regression used in "Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse" available at [ModernDive.com](https://moderndive.com/).


## Installation

Get the released version from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("moderndive")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# If you haven't installed remotes yet, do so:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("moderndive/moderndive")
```


## Demo

Let's fit a simple linear regression of teaching `score` (as evaluated by students) over instructor age for 463 courses taught by 94 instructors at the UT Austin:

```{r}
library(moderndive)
score_model <- lm(score ~ age, data = evals)
```

Among the many useful features of the `moderndive` package outlined in our essay ["Why should you use the moderndive package for intro linear regression?"](https://moderndive.github.io/moderndive/articles/why-moderndive.html) we highlight four functions in particular as covered there. 

We also mention the `geom_parallel_slopes()` function as **#4**.

#### 1. Get regression tables

Get a tidy regression table **with** confidence intervals:
```{r}
get_regression_table(score_model)
```

The confidence level is by default 95%; we can vary this with `conf.level`
```{r}
get_regression_table(score_model, conf.level = 0.99)
```

#### 2. Get fitted/predicted values and residuals

Get information on each point/observation in your regression, including fitted/predicted values & residuals (e.g. `score_hat` and `residual`), organized in a single data frame with intuitive variable names:

```{r}
get_regression_points(score_model)
```


#### 3. Get regression fit summaries

Get all the scalar summaries of a regression fit included in `summary(score_model)` along with the mean-squared error and root mean-squared error:

```{r}
get_regression_summaries(score_model)
```


#### 4. Plot parallel slopes models

Plot parallel slopes regression models involving one categorical and one numerical explanatory/predictor variable (something you cannot do using `ggplot2::geom_smooth()`).

```{r plot-example, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(evals, aes(x = age, y = score, color = ethnicity)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/plot-example-1.png")
```


## Other features

#### 1. Print markdown friendly tables

Want to output cleanly formatted tables in an R Markdown document? Just add `print = TRUE` to any of the three `get_regression_*()` functions.

```{r}
get_regression_table(score_model, print = TRUE)
```

#### 2. Predictions on new data

Want to apply your fitted model on new data to make predictions? No problem! Include a `newdata` data frame argument to `get_regression_points()`. 

For example, the Kaggle.com practice competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques){target="_blank"} requires you to fit/train a model to the provided `train.csv` training set to make predictions of house prices in the provided `test.csv` test set. The following code performs these steps and outputs the predictions in `submission.csv`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)

# Load in training and test set
train <- read_csv("https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive/raw/master/vignettes/train.csv")
test <- read_csv("https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive/raw/master/vignettes/test.csv")

# Fit model
house_model <- lm(SalePrice ~ YrSold, data = train)

# Make and submit predictions
submission <- get_regression_points(house_model, newdata = test, ID = "Id") %>%
  select(Id, SalePrice = SalePrice_hat)
write_csv(submission, "submission.csv")
```

The resulting `submission.csv` is formatted such that it can be submitted on Kaggle, resulting in a "root mean squared logarithmic error" leaderboard score of 0.42918.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive/raw/master/vignettes/leaderboard_orig.png")
```


## The Details

The three `get_regression` functions are wrappers of functions from the [`broom`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=broom/vignettes/broom.html){target="_blank"} package for converting statistical analysis objects into tidy tibbles along with a few added tweaks:

1. `get_regression_table()` is a wrapper for `broom::tidy()`
1. `get_regression_points()` is a wrapper for `broom::augment()`
1. `get_regression_summaries()` is a wrapper for `broom::glance()`

Why did we create these wrappers?

* The `broom` package function names `tidy()`, `augment()`, and `glance()` don't mean anything to intro stats students, where as the `moderndive` package function names `get_regression_table()`, `get_regression_points()`, and `get_regression_summaries()` are more intuitive.
* The default column/variable names in the outputs of the above 3 functions are a little daunting for intro stats students to interpret. We cut out some of them and renamed many of them with more intuitive names. For example, compare the outputs of the `get_regression_points()` wrapper function and the parent `broom::augment()` function.

```{r}
get_regression_points(score_model)
library(broom)
augment(score_model)
```
