## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I changed the package's title from "An R Package for Tidyverse-Friendly Introductory Linear Regression" to the less redundant "Tidyverse-Friendly Introductory Linear Regression"


## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.5.0
* ubuntu 14.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.4, R-oldrel, R-devel
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note
