## Resubmission

This is a resubmission.

* Cchanged the package's title from "An R Package for Tidyverse-Friendly Introductory Linear Regression" to the less redundant "Tidyverse-Friendly Introductory Linear Regression"
* Switch hyperlink in `mythbusters_yawn.Rd` for one that works globally, not just US. I tested the url <http://chance.amstat.org/2013/04/looking-good/> on <https://www.uptrends.com/tools/uptime> and it is accessible from all checkpoints.
* Added one additional function: `get_correlation()`


## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.5.0
* ubuntu 14.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.4, R-oldrel, R-devel
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
