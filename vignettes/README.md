# Two possible outputs of `why-moderndive.Rmd`

The `why-moderndive.Rmd` R Markdown creates two possible outputs:

## Package Vignette

Knit `why-moderndive.Rmd` to html_vignette as you normally would.

## `rticles` format

Ensure in `why-moderndive.Rmd` -> YAML `output:` section (about line 37) -> YAML code relating to `rticles` is uncommented. Then knit as you normally would.
